# NameEntityRecognition
The name entity recognition project is defined as "seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as the person names, organizations, locations, etc.". I have tested LSTM/BiLSTM with two embedding methods on the CoNLL-2003 shared task data files.
